<p>This is a common error, but it's easily missed.  The issue arises when you have a self-closing tag that's not actually self-closing according to the HTML specification.  Browsers handle this inconsistently, sometimes resulting in unexpected behavior.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>&lt;br /&gt;</code></pre><p>The above is incorrect! The correct self-closing tag uses just one forward slash, not a space followed by one.</p><pre><code>&lt;br/&gt;</code></pre>
